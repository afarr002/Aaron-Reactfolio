## Description

I wanted to practice building with React, so I decided to test the waters with a static React portfolio. I've also never deployed an application to Netlify before, so I wanted to take on that challenge as well with no mentor, just following the docs to see if I could figure it out! This will act as my business card for the start of my development career, helping to showcase some of my skills and style of building!
