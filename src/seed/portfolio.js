    description:
      "I was sick of designing ReadMe files with structured markdown and proper information pertaining to my project. What to include, where to put what, how do I impress my fellow developers when they look at my repo? Well, I decided it started with ReadMe's that were consistent and informative across all of my websites and applications. So I designed and implemented this template generator, to ensure that my ReadMe files were professional looking, consistent, and encouraged other developers to reach out for collaboration! This is a CLI program, so there is no front end. There is a video demonstration, and you can fork the code directly from my repo and follow the run instructions in my ReadMe.",

Only, I wanted to do it my way... so I built, refactored, and built again the funtionality of their Tic Tac Toe tutorial. I refined my knowledge of passing props, setting state, and the basics of the React library! While it is currently in a very basic state, I am going use the opportunity to test a brand new CSS framework on it in the future.",
